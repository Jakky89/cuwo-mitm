FAQ
===

* **Q.** How do I pronounce 'cuwo'?

* **A.** 'coo-woo' (no, not 'kew-woh')

* **Q.** What is a MITM proxy?

* **A.** A MITM proxy sits between your client and server, and can manipulate
         and inject packets.

* **Q.** Can I donate to the project somehow?

* **A.** Yes! You don't have to, of course, but it will help bring
         the server forward.
